# Social Media Platform - MongoDB Schema and Javascript Implementation

## Overview

In this assignment, I implemented a MongoDB schema for a social media platform that includes the following functionalities:
- Register user details
- Send/Receive and Accept/Reject friend requests from users
- Create text-only posts and comments on their friend's posts
- A user can see only those posts which were created by their friends
- A user can see posts of people who are not their friends, only if a friend has posted a comment on it
